# Loop.md — Autonomous Agent-Assisted Swing Trading System (v0)

> Single source of truth for the building agent. This project is a **human-in-the-loop, daily-cadence, swing-trading assistant** for one retail user (IBKR Hong Kong cash account, small capital). It is a **research/learning tool, not an income engine**. Profit is NOT the primary success metric; a reliable, well-instrumented, safe loop is.

---

## 0. How the building agent must operate (the "loop")

On every work iteration:
1. Read this file top to bottom. Identify the **Current Phase** (Section 7) and the next unchecked item in the **Task Backlog** (Section 10).
2. Implement exactly that item. Keep changes small and reviewable.
3. Write/extend tests. Run the full test suite. Do not proceed if tests fail.
4. Update the checkbox, append a dated note to the **Progress Log** (Section 11), and stop for human review at every **Review Gate** (marked ⛔).
5. If anything is ambiguous or would require violating a Guardrail (Section 3), STOP and ask the human. Never guess on risk, money, or credentials.

Definition of "done" for v0 = **Phase 0 exit criteria met** (Section 7).

---

## 1. Vision & Goal

Build a system that, each US trading day:
- **monitors** markets, the user's holdings/watchlist, news, and account risk;
- runs **analysis sub-agents** to form theses;
- a **decision core** proposes candidate orders with rationale + confidence + explicit take-profit/stop-loss;
- a **hardcoded risk engine** validates or vetoes them;
- exposes a permanent **Finance portal** in Hermes Desktop and Web, and pushes survivors to Telegram, inside a fixed daily window for **explicit confirmation from either surface**;
- **executes** approved orders through a **pluggable broker layer** using set-and-forget order types;
- **logs everything** (paper and live kept separate) and **improves** analysis quality from feedback.

**Primary success metric:** a dependable loop + clean data that lets the user measure whether any edge survives paper → live. Not returns.

---

## 2. Hard constraints (shape the whole design)

- **Account:** IBKR Hong Kong, **CASH account** (no margin, < $25k). No PDT, but **T+1 settlement** ⇒ **no stock day-trading**; positions are held overnight / multiple days. **Swing/positional only.**
- **IBKR not opened yet** ⇒ Phase 0 runs entirely on a **PaperBroker** backend + **free market data**; IBKR is a **stub behind an interface** (instrumented for later).
- **User availability (critical):** user can only watch the US market **09:30–12:30 ET** (= **21:30–00:30 Asia/Shanghai**); offline afterwards until next day.
  - The agent **finalizes candidates and pushes them to Telegram at 11:30 ET** (23:30 Shanghai). User confirms **by 12:30 ET**.
  - Because the user is offline for the US afternoon, **approved orders must be set-and-forget**: **GTC limit**, **GTC stop-loss**, and/or **MOC/LOC** (market/limit-on-close, filling at 16:00 ET close while the user sleeps).
- **Capital is small and partly family money** ⇒ tiny position sizes, hard risk caps, human-in-loop mandatory.

---

## 3. Guardrails (NEVER violate)

- No HFT / intraday stock churn.
- **No autonomous order placement without human confirmation** in Phases 0–2.
- The **Risk Engine is pure code, deterministic, and authoritative**. The LLM/agent **cannot modify, disable, or bypass it**.
- **Self-improvement affects analysis/signal quality ONLY** — never risk limits, position caps, or order authority.
- **Per-trade risk ≤ 1.6%** of total equity (hard cap). **Daily drawdown circuit breaker = −4%** ⇒ halt new entries for the day.
- No live order unless `HUMAN_CONFIRM=true` AND `BROKER != paper`.
- **Model tools are not approval authority:** an LLM may research, propose, and query finance state, but it may never transition a candidate to `APPROVED` on its own. `approve_candidate` is an authenticated human action from Desktop, Web, or Telegram in Phases 0–2; its actor, surface, candidate version, and timestamp are ledger-audited.
- **Order authority is service-bound:** `place_order` is never a free-form LLM action. Only `ExecutionEngine` may submit it after an approved candidate has passed its final deterministic checks. A future Quant service may receive narrowly scoped autonomous authority only in Phase 3 under an explicit whitelist, per-strategy notional/risk limits, versioned deterministic rules, kill switch, and separate audit identity; discretionary LLM signals never gain that authority.
- Secrets (API keys) live in env / secrets store; never in code, logs, or the ledger.
- Every external dependency (data, LLM, broker) must be **mockable** so tests never hit the network.

## 4. Timezone-aware daily loop (state machine, times in ET)

| Time (ET) | Shanghai | Step |
|---|---|---|
| 09:30–11:00 | 21:30–23:00 | Monitors poll; analysis sub-agents build theses |
| 11:00–11:30 | 23:00–23:30 | Decision core aggregates → candidate orders; Risk Engine validates |
| **11:30** | **23:30** | **Publish risk-approved candidates to the Finance portal and push Telegram cards** |
| 11:30–12:30 | 23:30–00:30 | **User approves / edits / rejects from Desktop, Web, or Telegram**; approved → placed (GTC limit/stop or MOC/LOC) |
| 16:00 | 04:00 | MOC/LOC fills; resting GTC orders may fill |
| next 09:00 | next 21:00 | Reporter: overnight fills, ledger update, morning summary |

Order-type policy for approvals: **entries** = GTC limit or MOC/LOC; **protection** = GTC stop-loss (attach on entry fill via bracket/OCA); never leave a position without a resting stop.

---

## 5. Architecture (ports & adapters; keep the core broker-agnostic)

**5.1 Broker abstraction**
- `BrokerInterface`: `get_account()`, `get_positions()`, `get_quote(sym)`, `get_bars(sym, tf)`, `place_order(order)`, `cancel_order(id)`, `get_orders()`
- Adapters: **`PaperBroker`** (Phase 0; simulates fills at limit / next-bar / close with configurable slippage + commission; tracks cash/positions), `AlpacaPaperBroker` (optional), **`IBKRBroker`** (stub now; implement with `ib_async` later)
- `DataFeed` interface (`get_quote`, `get_bars`, `get_news`): adapters `YFinanceFeed` (now), IBKR feed (later)

**5.2 Monitors** (scheduled pollers; each persists timestamped snapshots)
- `MarketMonitor` (indices, VIX, breadth, risk-on/off)
- `PortfolioMonitor` (holdings + watchlist: chips/AI/storage/optical/grid + S&P/Dow)
- `NewsMonitor` (earnings calendar, macro, breaking; sentiment scoring)
- `CryptoMonitor` (optional; only after OSL permission + API support confirmed)
- `AccountRiskMonitor` (equity, P&L, drawdown, per-pool exposure, breaker status)

**5.3 Analysis sub-agents** — Fundamental, Technical, Sentiment/News, Macro; plus a **Debate agent** (bull vs bear). Start rule-based; upgrade to LLM.

**5.4 Decision core** (LLM; Hermes runtime) — consumes monitors + sub-agents + **memory** (user risk profile, past skills, trade journal) → candidate orders `{symbol, side, qty, order_type, limit, stop, tp, sl, rationale, confidence}`.

**5.5 Risk Engine** (pure code, authoritative) — size cap, exposure caps, daily drawdown breaker, liquidity/volatility checks; may **veto** or **shrink size**; agent cannot override.

**5.6 Confirmation service & gateways** — one server-authoritative candidate state machine shared by Desktop, Web, and Telegram. Render concise Telegram cards and native portal approval UI; collect approve/edit/reject; enforce the 11:30–12:30 ET window; expire stale candidates. A canonical candidate ID, idempotency key, authenticated actor/source (`desktop|web|telegram`), and immutable audit trail prevent double execution. Every edit and every approved candidate is re-validated by RiskEngine and ExecutionEngine immediately before broker submission.

**5.7 Execution & authority boundary** — translate human-approved candidates to broker calls; prefer GTC limit + attached GTC stop (bracket/OCA) or MOC/LOC; **re-validate price vs signal validity before send**; handle partials/rejects. `place_order` is a service capability exposed only to ExecutionEngine, not a generic conversational skill. In Phase 3, an independently versioned Quant executor may use the same path for a pre-approved, low-notional strategy whitelist; it must identify itself as `quant:<strategy_version>`, satisfy all existing RiskEngine/ledger gates, and be instantly disabled by the human kill switch.

**5.8 Ledger & durable market memory** — SQLite ledger stores signals, orders, trades (`mode = paper|live`), fills, pnl, rationale, and approval audit events; feeds statistics (win rate, payoff ratio, max drawdown). Monitor snapshots and fetched source documents are retained by trading date rather than discarded. The ledger remains the authoritative source for numerical/accounting facts; no vector index may be treated as an order, fill, or risk record.

**5.9 Finance portal (Desktop + Web)** — add a permanent `Finance` tab to the existing Hermes Desktop and Web applications. Match their current UI/UX, routes, design tokens, state patterns, and shared components; do not create a second dashboard or re-implement chat. The tab is a native, structured companion surface with paper/live mode switch, market regime/watchlist, positions, open orders, risk/breaker state, candidate approval queue, fills/audit timeline, daily reports, and historical research search. Start read-only; write actions are limited to the same Confirmation service described in §5.6.

**Research-first information architecture (Phase 0.5 requirement):** the Finance landing view is **Investment Research**, not an order queue. A human operator should see, in priority order: (1) a dated market/risk pulse — regime, VIX/breadth, breaker, data freshness, and material exposure/cash warnings; (2) a concise daily investment brief — macro/theme changes, watchlist movers, earnings/events, news, bull/bear synthesis, confidence and uncertainty; (3) supporting source citations and links into the historical knowledge store; and only then (4) an intentionally compact **Actions requiring attention** section for pending confirmations, expiring cutoffs, failed orders, and risk exceptions. The approval queue remains immediately reachable and badged, but is never the default Desktop tab or top Web section. Every displayed claim must identify its as-of time and source/absence of source; stale or unavailable data is an explicit warning, never silently presented as current.

**UI/UX contract (applies to every Finance change):** Finance is a first-class Hermes surface, not a visually separate trading dashboard. Reuse the existing Desktop/Web application shell, routes, page primitives, design tokens, typography, spacing, responsive behavior, status patterns, loading/empty/error states, and accessible interaction conventions. Do not introduce a parallel design system, a duplicate chat UI, or finance-specific visual language that conflicts with Hermes. Desktop and Web must provide the same information hierarchy while adapting to their native layouts. Their default Finance route/tab is permanently **Investment Research**; trade Queue is a secondary, clearly badged action surface and may never become the default simply because a candidate exists.

**Translation contract (applies to Finance and every future module):** every user-visible Desktop/Web string, empty/error/loading state, action label, accessibility label, notification, and date/number label must use the same i18n/catalog conventions as the surrounding Hermes surface. Add/update translations in the relevant existing locale catalogs in the same change; do not hard-code a Finance-only English or Chinese UI. Preserve localization in tests and review locale fallback behavior whenever shared components or navigation are extended.

**5.10 Finance knowledge store (historical research + semantic retrieval)** — persist collected daily research, financial news, earnings/quarterly reports, company filings, strategy notes, monitor snapshots, decision rationales, and post-trade reviews. Use three layers:
- **facts:** immutable source files and normalized structured data, partitioned by event date/trading date (JSONL/Parquet for market/news snapshots; SQLite ledger for trading records);
- **research documents:** normalized text with source URL/publisher, retrieval date, content hash, symbol/theme, event timestamp, trading date (ET), document type, entitlement/license status, and parser/model version;
- **local vector index:** `finance_knowledge` embeddings point back to document IDs and metadata. It accelerates semantic retrieval only; it never replaces source records, deterministic market data, or the Ledger.

For an initial small local corpus, embedded/local Qdrant persistence is acceptable. Before the Finance service becomes long-running, run Qdrant as a dedicated private Docker service (for example `hermes-finance-vector`) with a named/host-mounted data volume, backup procedure, and **no published host port**; only Finance-service containers may connect over the internal Docker network. The vector database is storage/search infrastructure, not an execution dependency: if it is unavailable, trading must fail closed for research-dependent new entries and never lose or alter Ledger records.

Use public/owned/licensed material only. Public investor-relations filings and openly published research may be ingested with provenance; Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, and similar publisher research may be indexed only when the user has legitimate access and the publisher's terms permit local retention/processing. Never bypass paywalls, credentials, robots controls, copyright restrictions, or redistribute report text. Preserve citations and return source links/snippets rather than treating third-party reports as untraceable model facts.

---

## 6. Core data schemas (initial; evolve as needed)

- `Signal(id, ts, source_agent, symbol, thesis, direction, confidence, features_json)`
- `Order(id, ts, mode, symbol, side, qty, order_type[LMT|STP|MOC|LOC|BRACKET], limit, stop, tp, tif[GTC|DAY], status, broker_ref)`
- `Trade(id, entry_order_id, exit_order_id, symbol, qty, entry_px, exit_px, pnl, r_multiple, hold_days, rationale, mode)`
- `Position(symbol, qty, avg_px, mkt_px, upnl, pool)`
- `AccountSnapshot(ts, mode, equity, cash, upnl, day_pnl, drawdown, breaker_state)`

Paper and live share identical schemas (only the `mode` tag differs) so paper-vs-live comparison is exact.

---

## 7. Multi-stage roadmap — goals, targets, exit criteria

**⛔ Review Gate at the end of every phase — human must approve before advancing.**

### Phase 0 — Paper loop (NOW, no IBKR)
- **Goal:** full daily loop runs on `PaperBroker` + free data + Telegram, honoring the 11:30 ET push window.
- **Build:** broker abstraction, PaperBroker, DataFeed, Ledger, Risk Engine (+ full tests), monitors, decision core (rule-based first, then LLM), Telegram gateway, execution, scheduler, reporter, IBKRBroker stub.
- **Exit criteria:** ≥ 20 trading days of paper trades logged end-to-end; all tests green; Risk Engine unit-test coverage 100%; reporter produces a daily summary; schemas frozen for paper=live parity.

### Phase 0.5 — Research-first operator experience & resilience (AFTER Phase-0 build review; while paper data accumulates)
- **Goal:** make Finance useful to a human reader every day before it becomes a busy order console: research and risk awareness are primary; execution controls are deliberate secondary actions.
- **Build:** PaperBroker restart rehydration; an Investment Research briefing contract/API; Desktop and Web research-first landing views; source-linked knowledge ingestion/search; earnings/event calendar; explicit data-freshness and risk-warning model; dedicated Finance Telegram bot before interactive mobile approvals.
- **Acceptance:** Desktop defaults to `Investment Research`; Web presents the same research/risk summary before any queue; Queue is a compact badged action area rather than the primary canvas; all briefs show as-of time, citations/unknowns, PAPER/LIVE mode, and actionable risk warnings; no UI path gains authority beyond §3/§5.6.

### Phase 1 — Shadow & tiny live (AFTER IBKR opens & funds)
- **Goal:** implement `IBKRBroker` (ib_async); run on **IBKR paper first**, then **tiny real money (a few hundred USD)**.
- **Target:** quantify the **sim→real gap** (slippage, fill quality, timing) using paper-vs-live ledger comparison.
- **Exit criteria:** ≥ 20 tiny-live trades; measured slippage/fill stats; loop stable under real fills; no guardrail breaches. Before entering Phase 1, complete at least one reviewed upstream Hermes sync cycle (§8 Fork maintenance) so live-trading work starts from a known, tested base.

### Phase 2 — Validated scaling
- **Goal:** grow size **only if** the ledger shows **reproducible positive expectancy after costs** (walk-forward OOS + live confirmation).
- **Exit criteria:** documented positive expectancy across ≥ 2 regimes; drawdown within limits; human sign-off.

### Phase 3 — Limited Quant automation (optional, far future)
- **Goal:** permit a separately versioned **Quant executor** to auto-place a whitelist of low-frequency, rule-clear, small-notional strategies (for example a scheduled rebalance or explicitly tested systematic entry). This is an experiment after paper/live evidence, not a grant of autonomous discretionary LLM trading.
- **Guardrail:** `quant:<strategy_version>` must use the same RiskEngine, Ledger, ExecutionEngine, per-strategy capital limits, trade whitelist, and human kill switch as manual flow. Every Quant order remains attributable, replayable, and immediately disableable; discretionary LLM analysis can inform research but cannot itself call `approve_candidate` or `place_order`.

---

## 8. Tech stack (suggested; the building agent may substitute with justification)

Python 3.11 · `ib_async` (later) · `alpaca-py` (optional) · `yfinance` · `pandas` · `APScheduler` (ET-aware) · `SQLite` + `SQLModel` · JSONL/Parquet source archive · local Qdrant (or equivalent local vector store) + configurable embedding provider · Hermes Agent runtime for Finance tools/skills/gateway · Electron/React Desktop + existing Web component system · LLM via OpenRouter/OpenAI/local (model-agnostic) · `pytest` · `pydantic` for schemas.

**Data source policy:** start free — `yfinance` / Yahoo Finance for quotes, bars, and basic news. Put any **paid feed behind the `DataFeed` interface as a stub** (Polygon / Alpaca data / IBKR) so it can be swapped in later without touching the core.

**Model plan (build → refine → maintain):** scaffold v0 with **Fable 5**; refine & complete with **Opus 4.8**; long-term maintenance with **Sonnet 5**. The decision core is model-agnostic (chosen via config), so switching models is a config change, not a rewrite.

**Hermes runtime:** this is a product-focused Hermes fork at `/Users/gongqing/projects/hermes-agent/`. Finance is a first-class, always-visible Desktop/Web module plus a dedicated backend service/agent. The generic Hermes core remains stable, while the Finance agent receives a fixed Finance toolset for its session lifetime; this preserves predictable prompts and isolates financial authority from unrelated conversations. Keep trading-domain code in a separately extractable package/service with a versioned API — do not entangle broker/risk/ledger semantics with generic Hermes internals.

**Fork maintenance (weekly, and before Phase 1):** this repository is a fork of the official Hermes Agent `main`. Each weekend, fetch the official `upstream/main`, compare it with our `main`, and create a dated integration branch for review. Inspect upstream changes for security fixes, gateway/platform behavior, provider/model changes, Desktop/Web design-system changes, and migration requirements. Resolve conflicts deliberately — preserve Finance authority boundaries, tests, translations, and the Hermes-native UI contract — then run the relevant full Python, Desktop/Web, Docker, and Finance test suites before merging. Never use `reset --hard`, force-push, or an unattended automatic merge; an upstream sync report must record compared commits, adopted/skipped features, conflicts/resolutions, tests, and any follow-up migrations. Keep Finance code isolated behind its service/API boundary so upstream integration remains tractable.

---

## 9. Testing & quality bar

- **Risk Engine:** exhaustive unit tests, 100% branch coverage. It is the safety core.
- Broker adapters tested against a mock exchange; order lifecycle (place→partial→fill→cancel→reject) covered.
- Scheduler tested for correct ET timing incl. DST; confirmation-window expiry tested.
- **Backtest harness** reuses the SAME signal + risk code paths; walk-forward / out-of-sample only; model slippage + commission.
- `DRY_RUN` mode default; live orders blocked unless `HUMAN_CONFIRM=true` and `BROKER != paper`.

---

## 11. Watchlist universe (monitored set, NOT a buy list)

The monitors track this whole universe; the decision core trades only a small risk-checked subset. It is deliberately structured along the **AI value-chain progression** so the system can reason about **rotation over the next 2–3 years: infrastructure (now) → memory/networking/power → application/software/cloud**. US tickers (IBKR US market). Verify tickers/IPO status in-app; `NewsMonitor` keeps the set current.

**Thesis backdrop (2026, keep updated):** inference cost fell ~10x in ~18 months; inference is now ~2/3 of AI compute (training→inference shift); the five hyperscalers (AMZN/MSFT/GOOGL/META/ORCL) ≈ $600B capex, ~75% to AI infra. Cheaper tokens ⇒ more viable AI products ⇒ demand broadens UP the stack toward software/application & cloud, while still feeding compute/memory/networking. The watchlist spans infra→application on purpose so the system catches the rotation early. (Caveat: rotation timing is uncertain and valuations are high — hedges matter.)

Each symbol is tagged `{theme, ai_phase(infra|memory|network|power|application|cloud), role(core|conviction|rotation|hedge)}`; the risk engine enforces **per-role exposure caps**.

- **A. Base / reference indices** (context, low-vol anchors) — `SPY`/`VOO`/`IVV` (S&P 500), `DIA` (Dow), `QQQ` (Nasdaq-100), `VTI`.
- **B. AI infra — compute & chips** (current conviction) — `NVDA`, `AMD`, `AVGO`, `MRVL`, `TSM`, `ASML`, `AMAT`, `LRCX`, `KLAC`.
- **C. AI infra — memory / storage** (supercycle) — `MU`, `WDC`/`SNDK`.
- **D. AI infra — networking / optical** — `ANET`, `CIEN`, `LITE`, `COHR`, `CRDO`.
- **E. AI infra — systems / power / cooling / energy** — `SMCI`, `DELL`, `VRT`, `ETN`, `GEV`; power utilities `CEG`, `VST`; nuclear/uranium `CCJ`, `URA`; data-center REITs `EQIX`, `DLR`.
- **F. AI application / software / cloud** (the 2–3y upcycle to watch early) — hyperscalers `MSFT`, `AMZN`, `GOOGL`, `META`, `ORCL`; software/SaaS `PLTR`, `NOW`, `CRM`, `SNOW`, `DDOG`, `CRWD`, `ADBE`; software/cloud ETFs `IGV`, `WCLD`, `SKYY`.
- **G. Rotation / rate-sensitive upcycle** — biotech `XBI`, `IBB` (benefit as rates fall); optional small-caps `IWM`.
- **H. Hedges / diversifiers** (uncorrelated to the AI bet) — energy/oil&gas `XLE`, `XOP`, `XOM`, `CVX`; gold `GLD`/`IAU`; long/mid bonds `TLT`, `IEF`.
- **I. Crypto** (only after OSL permission + API support confirmed) — `BTC`, `ETH`.

## 12. Long-horizon thesis framework — value migration / Perez cycle (DIRECTIONAL & heavy-position ONLY, NOT daily trading)

**Purpose:** a slow-cadence (monthly/quarterly) lens for WHERE to overweight over years, kept strictly separate from the daily order loop. Output = directional tilts + heavy-position candidates that inform the human's rebalancing — never intraday entries.

**Framework (Carlota Perez, "Technological Revolutions & Financial Capital"):** every tech revolution runs Installation phase (infrastructure frenzy, financial-capital speculation, ends in a crash at the "turning point") → Deployment phase (broad-adoption golden age; value accrues to the application/usage layer). Historically each phase ≈ 10–15y; the biggest durable fortunes are made in DEPLOYMENT, not the installation frenzy. Value migrates UP the stack over time: **Infrastructure → Platform/Cloud → Application.**

**AI wave map (dynamic — the monitors keep company lists current):**
- **Wave 1 — Infrastructure / picks-&-shovels (NOW):** compute/GPU (NVDA, AMD, AVGO, MRVL), foundry/equipment (TSM, ASML, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC), memory (MU, WDC), optical/networking (ANET, CIEN, LITE, COHR, CRDO, GLW), power/cooling/energy (VRT, ETN, GEV, CEG, VST), DC REITs (EQIX, DLR). **CISCO LESSON:** the tech leader can be right yet a terrible investment if bought at the installation peak (Cisco +236% into 2000 → −85%, no new high for 20y). Distinguish **durable-moat infra** (TSM, ASML) from **commoditizing infra** (lost-moat risk). Trim conviction infra into frenzy; never chase the peak.
- **Wave 2 — Platform / cloud / model services (≈1–2y):** selling compute/tokens/models on top of infra. Reps: hyperscalers MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, ORCL, META; model providers (OpenAI/Anthropic, mostly private). **CAUTION:** pure "pipes" commoditize — token prices already −~95%, so pure API/token sellers face margin compression (like debt-laden telecom carriers that died post-2000). Value accrues to platforms with **distribution + data moat**, not commodity token-sellers.
- **Wave 3 — Application / deployment golden age (≈2–3y+):** killer apps/agents/vertical-SaaS on near-zero token cost; the most durable value (historically Google/Amazon/Meta on cheap bandwidth). Reps: existing platforms extending (distribution edge) + new application-layer entrants (PLTR early example; many still private/newly public). Direction = enterprise AI, agents, vertical SaaS, AI-native software.

**Timing (AI faster than history):** still deep in Installation, near the turning point. Working assumption: installation ~2022–2027, a turning-point shakeout/crash plausibly in the **2026–2028** window (matches the portfolio's stated high-risk window), deployment golden age ~2028+. Timing is uncertain — do not force it.

**Directional rules for the decision core (heavy-position lens):**
1. Position ahead of the value migration: shift long-term weight infra → platform → application over quarters (not days) as evidence accrues.
2. Do not chase infrastructure at frenzy peaks (Cisco risk); trim conviction infra into strength.
3. Prefer moats/distribution over commoditizing pipes; be wary of pure token/connectivity sellers.
4. Treat a major AI-infra drawdown (the turning point) as the **rotation window** infra → deployment winners, not a reason to panic-sell the whole book.
5. Always keep uncorrelated hedges (energy/gold/bonds) — installation phases end in crashes.

**Phase-tracker signals monitors should feed this review:** inference $/token cost curve; inference-vs-training compute mix; hyperscaler capex + ROI commentary; application-layer revenue growth; any >15–20% AI-infra index drawdown (turning-point candidate); rate cuts (aid deployment/rotation).

**Cadence:** runs in a MONTHLY/QUARTERLY "strategy & allocation review" step; output feeds the human's rebalancing, never the daily order flow.

## 13. Progress log (building agent appends; newest first)

- 2026-07-12 — UI/UX rule reinforced by human decision: Finance must inherit Hermes Desktop/Web's existing shell, components, tokens, and interaction patterns rather than becoming a separate dashboard. `Investment Research` is permanently the default Finance tab/route; Queue is secondary and badged. This is a standing contract for all subsequent Finance work.
- 2026-07-13 — Maintenance decision: all Finance/future-module user-facing strings must follow Hermes i18n catalog conventions and ship translations with their feature changes. This fork will also review official Hermes `upstream/main` weekly on weekends through a dated, tested integration branch/report; no automatic overwrite/merge. At least one reviewed sync is a Phase-1 prerequisite.
- 2026-07-12 — Operator UX decision for Phase 0.5: Finance is an **Investment Research** product before it is an order console. Current Desktop defaults to `Queue` and current Web renders `ApprovalQueue` first; both must be inverted after Phase-0 review. New landing order: dated market/risk pulse → daily investment research brief with sources/uncertainty → compact actions requiring attention. Queue stays reachable/badged but is not the default surface. Added explicit Phase-0.5 roadmap/backlog and acceptance criteria; no order authority changes.
- 2026-07-13 — P0.5 backlog#6 (code half) + #7 done: TelegramSurfaceAdapter gains allowlist auth (TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS usernames/ids; empty allowlist = closed) and FINANCE_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN dedicated-bot support (auto-enables interactive approvals; shared gateway bot stays outbound-only) — bot creation itself awaits the human (BotFather). Upstream sync dry run: remote `upstream` = NousResearch/hermes-agent; 67 commits ahead of merge-base 4281151ae; dry merge = ZERO conflicts; report docs/upstream-sync/2026-07-13.md; branch sync/upstream-2026-07-13 kept for the reviewed weekend merge. 5 new tests.
- 2026-07-13 — **Phase 0.5 started** (human approved the Phase-0 build review by instructing "start building next phase"). Service now launchd-managed (`com.hermes.finance`, KeepAlive+RunAtLoad; docker-izing trader deferred). P0.5 backlog#1 done: `rehydrate.py` + `PaperBroker.restore_state` — on serve restart the ledger is replayed into a fresh broker (cash from fill history, weighted-avg positions, ALL resting orders incl. bracket children with reservations + OCA wiring rebuilt); ExecutionEngine seeded with ledger fill ids (no duplicate records) and protective-stop map (r_multiple survives restart). §4 invariant verified: restored protective stops still fire; starting-cash mismatch detected via snapshot cross-check. 11 tests; suite 634 green. Restart-resets-paper-account limitation is CLOSED.
- 2026-07-12 (evening) — Deployment + LLM upgrade: `llm.py` LLMAnalyst (OpenAI-compatible; DeepSeek-v4-flash default, GLM5-turbo fallback via FINANCE_LLM_PROVIDER; analysis-only voice in the debate, confidence capped 0.8, ANY failure ⇒ no signal — rule-based agents remain in charge; keys from ~/.hermes/.env, never logged; 9 tests, suite 623). Docker image rebuilt w/ Finance web tab; dashboard gets HERMES_FINANCE_SERVICE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:9319 (container→host proxy verified: /api/finance/v1/health routes + auth-gates). hermes-finance-vector container started. Telegram "Hermes Finance" GROUP verified for OUTBOUND cards/reports; interactive getUpdates conflicts with the Hermes gateway holding the same bot token ⇒ approvals via portal for now (dedicated finance bot token = Phase 0.5 TODO). `serve --check-now` runs a one-shot monitors+report cycle at startup.
- 2026-07-12 — **Phase 0 build COMPLETE — ⛔ Review Gate reached; awaiting human review.** Backlog "E2E dry run" done: `dailyloop.py` orchestrates §4 (morning report → monitors → sub-agents/debate → decision core → RiskEngine → ConfirmationService publish → human surfaces → cutoff execution → close fills); `simulate.py` + `python -m swing_trader simulate --days 22 --crash-day 12` (crash: stops fire, risk-off blocks entries, max DD 5.39%); E2E test drives 22 simulated days with REAL HTTP web approvals + Telegram mock approvals + rejections + server-side expiry + never-naked-position invariant checked daily. `python -m swing_trader serve` = production paper loop + Finance API :9319. Suite 614 green. Fixed /v1/trades serialization (entry_ts) + body-surface fallback so Desktop audits as "desktop". Known Phase-0 limitations: PaperBroker state is in-memory (serve restart resets paper account; ledger keeps history — rehydration is a 0.5 TODO); LLM decision/analysis cores are stubs (rule-based v0 active).
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog "Finance surfaces + knowledge + vector" done: Web tab (`web/src/pages/FinancePage.tsx` + finance/* — approval queue w/ idempotent actions, breaker banner, offline panel; typecheck/test/build green, lint-scoped clean). Desktop view (`apps/desktop/src/app/finance/*` — react-query, non-overlay route, command-center entry; typecheck green; surface rides in body due to IPC header limitation). `knowledge.py` (FactsArchive dated JSONL append-only; DocumentStore w/ mandatory provenance, restricted-license refusal, sha256 dedupe; Qdrant `finance_knowledge` index embedded/remote w/ HashingEmbedder placeholder + KnowledgeUnavailable FAIL-CLOSED; 25 tests). `hermes-finance-vector` compose service (pinned image, no published ports, internal network, named volume) + backup/restore scripts + `docs/finance-vector.md` drill.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog "Finance service API + confirmation state machine" done: `confirmation.py` ConfirmationService — ONE server-authoritative state machine (publish→approve/edit/reject/expire; idempotency keys replay-safe incl. across restart via the audit trail; per-candidate versions catch stale cards; system surface can publish/expire but NEVER approve; every attempt incl. refusals audited with actor+surface+version into the new append-only `audit_events` ledger table; edits re-validated structurally AND through a RiskEngine hook). `api.py` FastAPI service (`/v1`: health/account/orders/fills/trades/stats/snapshots/market/watchlist/reports/candidates/pending/audit + POST action; NO order-placement endpoint exists — §3 order authority stays with ExecutionEngine; 503-degrades when loop idle). Runs IN the loop process (own port 9319); `hermes_cli/finance_proxy.py` mounts `/api/finance/*` on the dashboard (inherits dashboard auth; strips session tokens; 503 offline hint). Telegram becomes a surface adapter of the same machine (`dailyloop.TelegramSurfaceAdapter`). 26+20 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog "Backtest harness" done: `backtest.py` — ReplayFeed (as-of cursor, no look-ahead), Backtester reuses the SAME TechnicalAgent→Debate→DecisionCore→RiskEngine→ExecutionEngine→PaperBroker→Ledger paths (§9); decisions on day i fill on bar i+1; auto-approve exists ONLY here (hard-wired Mode.PAPER, isolated ledger — documented bypass); WalkForwardBacktester picks params on TRAIN by expectancy, reports TEST-window-only combined stats. 14 tests (determinism, next-bar fills, OOS isolation, risk-off blocks entries, tiny-equity veto). Suite 528 green.
- 2026-07-12 — Product direction updated: Finance is a permanent first-class Hermes Desktop/Web tab, backed by a dedicated Finance service and a shared Desktop/Web/Telegram confirmation state machine. Added durable three-layer research storage (dated facts, normalized documents, local vector retrieval) with provenance/licensing requirements; third-party institutional research is ingestible only through legitimate access and permitted terms. Explicit authority split: human approval in Phases 0–2; ExecutionEngine-only broker submission; future low-notional Quant automation is separately versioned/whitelisted and never discretionary LLM authority. Added a private persistent Qdrant deployment/backup milestone.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#13/#14/#15 done: `scheduler.py` (pure zoneinfo state machine per §4 — substituted for APScheduler with justification; NYSE-2026 holiday table; DST-exact tests in EDT+EST; injectable-clock DailyLoopRunner fires each event once/day; 77 tests). `reporter.py` (AccountView paper/live switch, morning summary w/ overnight fills + stats + safety footer, push preamble, 4096-char clamp). `ibkr_broker.py` stub (all methods NotImplementedError w/ detailed ib_async TODOs: bracket/ocaGroup mapping, T+1 settledCash tracking, pacing, 7497/7496 ports; Phase-1 acceptance checklist). 12+ tests each.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#11 done: `telegram_gateway.py` — plain Bot HTTP API via requests (documented substitution for python-telegram-bot per §8: 3 endpoints, injectable transport, token never in logs/exceptions). Cards + ≤64-byte callback_data; 11:30→12:30 ET window enforced in both DST regimes; approve/reject/edit (edits re-validated through CandidateOrder — protection cannot be stripped, qty>0 enforced); post-cutoff: all actions refused; expire_stale → EXPIRED. 36 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#7/#8/#9 done: `monitors.py` (Market/Portfolio/News/AccountRisk pollers + JsonlSink; regime rules risk_off-first; ATR14/ADV20 → LiquidityInfo for RiskEngine; positions RE-TAGGED with watchlist roles — required for pool-exposure caps; AccountRiskMonitor is THE breaker-tripper, clamped to −4% even with loose params; 46 tests). `analysis.py` (Technical/Fundamental/Sentiment/Macro rule-based v0 + DebateAgent bull-vs-bear synthesis w/ normalized confidence-weighted vote + disagreement penalty; SHORT = avoid/trim in cash account; LLMClient port + stub for Phase 0.5; 50 tests). Suite total 514 green.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#12 done: `execution.py` ExecutionEngine — human-approved candidates only (APPROVED/EDITED); re-validates before send (§5.7: valid_until, adverse drift >1.5% vs ref_px, last≤stop ⇒ "thesis broken"); entries always sent as GTC BRACKET (LMT+sl upgraded — never a naked position); discretionary exits cancel resting protection first and RESTORE the stop if the exit is rejected; GuardrailError blocks live mode without the §3 triple gate; sync_fills() dedupes into ledger with stop_px for r_multiple. 17 tests (incl. full entry→stop-out roundtrip vs real PaperBroker+Ledger).
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#10 done: `decision.py` RuleBasedDecisionCore — debate signals → BRACKET entries (limit = last−0.5%, sl = 2×ATR, tp = 3×ATR, risk-based sizing re-using RiskParams' CLAMPED per-trade cap) / MOC exits (confidence ≥0.6; survive risk-off); no pyramiding; risk-off blocks entries only; top-3 by confidence. MemoryStore port + JsonMemory (Hermes adapter = Phase 0.5 TODO, keeps repo Hermes-agnostic per §8): memory can only LOWER confidence (§3: self-improvement touches analysis quality only). LLMDecisionCore stub (model-agnostic via config, §8 model plan). 23 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#6 done: `risk.py` RiskEngine — pure/deterministic, 11-step first-veto-wins sequence (SELL=exit always allowed incl. breaker-tripped; breaker by state OR drawdown; liquidity None ⇒ veto ["no data, no trade"]; ADV/vol/per-trade-1.6%/cash/role-cap checks with shrink-or-veto). Hard caps re-clamped AT USE TIME (params cannot loosen: 5.0%→1.6%, −10%→−4%). **100% branch coverage verified** (149 stmts, 58 branches, 0 missed). 56 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#5 done: `ledger.py` SQLModel ledger (signals/candidates/orders/fills/trades/snapshots; every row mode-tagged; ISO-8601 TEXT timestamps preserve tz; weighted entry, partial-close splits, proportional commission attribution, r_multiple from recorded stop; stats: win rate/payoff/expectancy/max-DD). 32 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#4 done: `datafeed.py` YFinanceFeed (lazy yfinance import, injectable ticker_factory so tests never hit network; quote fast_info→history fallback; bars 1d/1h/1wk tz-normalized; news handles old+new yfinance formats) + StubPaidFeed placeholder (§8 data policy). 30 tests.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#3 done: `paper_broker.py` PaperBroker (cash reservations across resting BUYs; no-short; LMT gap-open improvement; STP slippage; MOC/LOC; volume-capped partials; BRACKET parent→OCA children activate on fill, sibling auto-cancel; DAY expiry; day-anchored drawdown). Note: per ports&adapters split, quotes/bars live on the DataFeed port, not BrokerInterface (documented deviation from §5.1's method list). 46 tests. Suite total 231 green.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#2 done: §6 schemas in `trader/swing_trader/schemas.py` (Signal/Order/Fill/Trade/Position/AccountSnapshot/CandidateOrder + enums; tz-aware ts enforced; bracket price-geometry validation; BUY entry candidates REQUIRE a protective stop per §4) + `interfaces.py` ports (BrokerInterface, DataFeed, Quote/Bar/NewsItem/PlaceResult). 57 tests green.
- 2026-07-12 — Backlog#1 done: `trader/` scaffold (self-contained subproject in the Hermes fork, zero Hermes-internal imports, extractable to its own repo pre-Phase-1). `Settings` (pydantic-settings; env names = §3 verbatim; hard-cap validation: per-trade >1.6% and breaker looser than −4% rejected at load; `live_orders_allowed` requires HUMAN_CONFIRM ∧ BROKER≠paper ∧ ¬DRY_RUN), structured JSON logging with secret-redaction filter, `.env.example`, README. 28 tests green (`cd trader && uv run pytest`).
- 2026-07-12 — Added §12 long-horizon value-migration framework (Perez cycle; infra→platform→application; Cisco lesson; 2026–28 turning-point window; directional rules for quarterly heavy-position review, separate from daily loop).
- 2026-07-12 — Loop.md v0: watchlist universe (AI value-chain phased), confirmed params (per-trade 1.6%, daily breaker −4%, confirm 11:30→12:30 ET), data policy (free yfinance now, paid stub), model plan (Fable 5 scaffold → Opus 4.8 refine → Sonnet 5 maintain), Hermes fork path. Awaiting scaffold.
